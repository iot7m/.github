# H5Radar — Health Radar for Modern Engineering Teams

**H5Radar** is an open-source platform for documenting and visualizing your organization's technology stack in a structured and consistent way.

It provides a clear view of technologies used across projects and teams, allowing you to track maturity, categorize technologies by domain, and analyze license compliance.

## Key features

- A technology catalog where each technology is classified by:
    - **Domain** (e.g. Languages, Infrastructure, Datastores, Data Management|Tools)
    - **Maturity** (e.g. Adopt, Trial, Assess, Hold)
- Visualization of selected technologies as an interactive radar chart
- License tracking with compliance levels (e.g. approved, restricted, prohibited)
- Pie chart visualization for license risk analysis

## Installation

H5Radar supports multiple installation modes: from prebuilt binaries and from source code. All installation methods are documented in detail in the [official documentation](https://docs.h5radar.com/).

### Quick Start with Docker Compose

If you want to quickly try out H5Radar without configuring a full environment, you can use our Docker Compose setup. The basic steps are:

1. Clone the docker compose repository from the [`docker`](https://github.com/h5radar/docker) repository
2. Run the docker compose with the command:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

### Installation with Ansible

The simplest and recommended way is to install from prebuilt binaries using the Ansible installer provided in the [`ansible`](https://github.com/h5radar/ansible) repository.  The basic steps are:

1. Clone the Ansible installer repository from the [`ansible`](https://github.com/h5radar/ansible) repository
2. Copy the `inventory/development` directory to `inventory/production`
3. Edit the `hosts` file inside the inventory to specify the IP address of your target virtual machine
4. Configure installation parameters such as:
    - SSL certificate type (self-signed, Let's Encrypt, or external certificates)
    - Reverse proxy choice (Nginx or Apache)
    - Other relevant parameters
5. Run the Ansible playbook installer with the command:
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -v --diff --inventory inventory/production main.yml
   ```

This installation process sets up all required components, including the web UI and backend services.


## Roadmap

Planned features under active discussion:
